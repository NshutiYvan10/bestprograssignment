1. What is Logging?

Logging is the process of recording information about a program's execution for the purpose of monitoring, debugging, and analyzing its behavior.
Logs capture a wide range of data such as status messages, error reports, and operational details that provide insights into the software's functioning.
Developers use logging to trace program flow, identify issues, and understand the conditions under which certain events occur.

2. Why Logging is Important

Logging is crucial for several reasons:

Debugging: Logs help developers track down and fix bugs by providing a detailed history of program execution and the sequence of events leading up to an error.
Monitoring: Logs offer real-time insights into the state and health of an application, enabling administrators to detect and respond to issues promptly.
Auditing and Compliance: Logs can serve as a record of system activity, helping organizations meet regulatory requirements and perform audits.
Performance Analysis: By analyzing logs, developers can identify performance bottlenecks and optimize system performance.
Security: Logs help detect suspicious activities and potential security breaches, allowing for timely responses to threats.
User Behavior Analysis: Logging can provide valuable data on how users interact with the application, guiding improvements and feature development.
3. Understanding Logging Levels

Logging levels are used to categorize and control the output of log messages based on their severity and importance. Common logging levels include:

TRACE: Very detailed logging intended for diagnosing specific problems. Typically used by developers during the development process.
DEBUG: Provides more granular information than higher levels, useful for debugging and understanding application flow. It’s often turned off in a production 
environment to avoid verbose logging.
INFO: General information about the application's execution. These messages highlight the progress of the application without being too verbose.
WARN: Indicates potentially harmful situations. Warnings signal issues that do not currently affect the application’s operation but could cause problems in the future.
ERROR: Records error events that might still allow the application to continue running. It indicates serious issues that need attention.
FATAL: Severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort. It represents critical failures that require immediate attention.
